# qiime_pipes
Qiime2 pipeline for 16S data processing. 

## Locate data with 01_fetch_accesions.sh
- This is a hybrid approach pipeline because UoU CHPC does not currently have e-direct module. Run 01_fetch_accessions.sh locally to download accession text file from Bioproject.
  - Requires miniconda environment named sra-env with e-direct installed.
  - This script is designed for apple architecture. If using apple silicon make sure to have Rosetta 2 emulation enabled with miniconda3-x86_64 installed.
