                          created upon importing. Use --show-importable-types
                          to see what importable semantic types are available
                          in the current deployment.                [required]

  --show-importable-types Show the semantic types that can be supplied to
                          --type to import data into an artifact.
  --show-importable-formats
                          Show formats that can be supplied to --input-format
